> ⚠️ **Important Notes Before You Dive Deeper into WPA2 Cracking**

## 🎯 Target Selection Matters

* This method works best on **weaker targets**, especially when:

  * You **know or can assume the password pattern**, like `8-digit numeric` (e.g., `12345678`).
  * The password is **default**, **simple**, or from a **predictable set**.

## 🐌 Brute-Force Takes Time

* Brute-forcing complex passwords (e.g., with uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and longer than 10 characters) can take **days**, **months**, or even **years**. 🕰️
* Without knowledge of the password length or format, you're practically trying to find a needle in a digital haystack. 🧵🧮

## 💸 Hardware Makes a Huge Difference

* **High-end GPUs** or even **supercomputers** are often needed to attempt brute-force attacks on strong passwords.
* Your average laptop will struggle or **overheat** trying to crack anything beyond a weak password. 🔥💻

## 🔒 WPA2 is Still Strong

* WPA2 with a **strong, random password** is incredibly secure against brute-force.
* This method **does not work** against:

  * WPA3 networks
  * Properly secured WPA2 with long, random passwords

## ✅ Use Wordlists When Possible

* For unknown passwords, try **wordlist attacks** (like using `rockyou.txt`) before brute-forcing.
* It saves time and power ⚡ compared to blind guessing.

## 🚫 Don't Break the Law

* Only test this on networks you **own** or have **explicit permission** to audit.
* Unauthorized attacks are **illegal** and unethical. ⚖️
